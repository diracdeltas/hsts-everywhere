This is a simple proof-of-concept Firefox addon for doing HSTS forcing. It inserts a list of hosts seeded from the HTTPS Everywhere rulesets (generated by utils/simple.py) into Firefox's internal HSTS database.

## Installation
Load hsts-everywhere.xpi into Firefox. Alternatively, download the Firefox addon SDK, follow the activation instructions, and then do `cfx run` in the root directory.

## Testing it out
Click on the widget icon that appears in the addons bar to add/remove the list of new HSTS rules.

You can check HSTS behavior by going to a URL like http://3bbwifi.com.
